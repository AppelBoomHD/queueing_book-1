* Analysis and simulation of queueing systems

The most important file is =queueing_book.pdf=, which contains the text, exercises (which I use for inspiration for the exams) with hints and solutions, for my course on queueing theory.

Comments are more than welcome of course: n.d.van.foreest@rug.nl.

- =tex_files/= contains the source files in latex

To make the book, run:

#+begin_src shell
pdflatex queueing_book
pythontex queueing_book
pdflatex queueing_book
#+end_src

or, if you have installed =arara=:

#+begin_src shell
arara queueing_book
#+end_src
